		<h2 align="center">Learning</h2>
		<b class="c5">Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences.The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants. Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved.</b>

		<h2 align="center">Equal Opportunities</h2>
		<b class="c5">Many believe that equal opportunity requires that advantaged positions be subject to open competition. (This view is sometimes captured by the slogan, “Careers open to talents.”) The idea there is that jobs and limited educational places should be open to all and that the selection procedures for them should be designed to identify the best-qualified candidates. In practice, that appears to be an efficient way of allocating jobs so as to maximize productivity and of distributing prized educational places to those who are likely to gain the most from them.</b>

	<div class="c1 c2">
		<img src="images\act4.webp" class="c3 c4">
		<h2 align="center">Activities Done</h2>
		<b class="c5">In this learning model, your kids are constantly involved in the on-goings inside the classroom via various activities that cater to their comprehensive growth. Suffice it to say, the importance of activity-based learning is manifold. For instance, taking part in day-to-day activities will help the cognitive and educational growth of your little ones. 


			Furthermore, as schools promote the notion of community learning, your kids will also learn the importance of group activities. Moreover, such actions will lead to the young ones receiving positive reinforcement from their peers and teachers – something which is crucial in building their self-dependency. </b>

		<h2 align="center">Placements</h2>
		<b class="c5">When the candidate is selected for a particular post and when he reports to duty, the organization has to place him or her in the job for which he or she is selected which is being done through placement. Placement is the act of offering the job to a finally selected candidate. It is the act of finally assigning the rank and responsibility to an employee, identifying him with a particular job.</b>
